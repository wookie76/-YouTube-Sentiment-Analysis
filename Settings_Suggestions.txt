
YouTube Sentiment Analysis: Configuration Guide

This guide helps you adjust settings for analyzing YouTube video transcripts. The right
settings depend on the video's length and your analysis goals.

I. Video Length Categories:

Short (< 5 minutes): News clips, short tutorials, quick updates.

Medium (5-30 minutes): Vlogs, explainers, product reviews, most YouTube
content.

Long (30+ minutes): Lectures, interviews, documentaries, podcasts.

II. Configuration Sliders:

Chunk Size (Words):

What it does: Divides the transcript into smaller parts (chunks) for
analysis. Smaller chunks provide more detail, larger chunks give a
broader overview.

Recommendations:

Short Videos: 50-100 words. Start with 50 for very granular analysis.
If that's too detailed, increase to 75-100.

Medium Videos: 100-200 words. Balances detail and summarization.

Long Videos: 250-500 words. Focuses on major topic shifts.

Advanced (Behind the Scenes): We also use sentence boundaries whenever
possible, as sentences are naturally meaningful units.

Top Keywords per Chunk:

What it does: How many of the most important words/phrases to identify
within each chunk.

Recommendations:

Short Videos: 3-5 keywords.

Medium Videos: 5-7 keywords.

Long Videos: 7-10 keywords. Consider going higher (10-15) for very
large chunks.

Advanced (Behind the Scenes) Keyword extraction leverages spaCy, KeyBERT and
TextRank for extracting relevant, multi-word phrases when installed. Good
quality keyword choices are critical.

Top Keywords Overall:

What it does: How many of the most important words/phrases to identify
across the entire video.

Recommendations:

Short Videos: 5-10 keywords.

Medium Videos: 10-20 keywords.

Long Videos: 20-50 keywords.

Advanced: We consider both the frequency of keywords and how unique they
are to this specific video, to avoid showing very common/generic words.

Lemmatization (Checkbox):

What it does: Should analysis consider just root meaning of words in context or
are verb tenses, plurals etc important on their own

Recommendations:
*Lemmatization On (Default and Recommended in general): Analyzes word roots
which aids overall accuracy. Better text interpreation.
*Lemmatization off : Useful when subtle difference in wording can change
underlying sentiment (more precision). Can increase noise in analysis and
make interpretation more complex.

Advanced: High accuracy, well understood keywords critical for high quality
summary data.

III. Key Principles:

Granularity vs. Overview: Smaller chunk sizes and fewer keywords per chunk
provide more detailed, granular analysis. Larger chunk sizes and more keywords
provide a broader overview.

Video Length Matters: Adjust settings based on the length of your video.

Experimentation: These are starting points. Feel free to adjust the sliders
and see how the results change! The best settings depend on the specific video.

Lemmatization When in doubt, begin with lemmatization switched ON.

IV. Under the Hood (Advanced Details - Optional for the User):

Sentence-Based Chunking: Where possible, we prioritize chunking by complete
sentences, as this is often more semantically meaningful than fixed word counts.

Keyword Quality: We use sophisticated techniques, combining KeyBERT/TextRank
(text summarization methods), and spaCy(language comprehension library) to
extract not just single words, but also key phrases (e.g., "natural language
processing"). This provides richer insights than simple word counts.

Stop Word Filtering: Common words ("the," "a," "is") and YouTube-specific
terms ("like," "subscribe") are automatically filtered out to ensure keywords
are meaningful.

Transcript pre-processing Youtube ASR transcripts improved for accuracy by
program, to remove extraneous symbols and ensure correct sentence boundaries,
before analysis.
